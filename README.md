This project has been made for a basic react+redux course.

*This version of the game is not random, you can - in theory - solve it. Every position of the game generates a tile with a specific value in a specific point*

To see this code live http://www.obsidianart.com/projects/2048/ (you can use redux devtool to undo etc)

Based on a boilerplate https://github.com/stylesuxx/generator-react-webpack-redux

To start:
- npm start

Test and coverage:
- npm test

Steps
- Step 1: Clone the boilerplate
- Step 2: draw a board
- Step 3: add tiles
- Step 4: add Sass (change the require on top of app.js)
- Step 5: add keyboard listeners
- Step 6: move tiles to state and add the first movement concept
- Step 7: time to write a test (failing isolated test for business logic)
- Step 7: Right movement, no merging
- Step 8: full algorithm
- Step 9: Adding CSS
- Step 10: Adding reducer yo react-webpack-redux:reducer main
- Step 11: Moving state to reducer (breakes the game)
- Step 12: Creating actions, dispatching, moving business logic (game is back)
- Step 13: Testing the game logic in the reducer
- Step 14: Animation
- Step 15: Score
- Step 16: Redux dev tool
- Step 17: Moving business logic
- Step 18: Adding logic to add a tile
- Step 19: Adding game over concept
- Step 20: Adding new tile animation
- Step 21: Moving tiles to its own component
- Step 22: Game Over Screen (Trigger by invalid move not by "no more moves")
- Step 23: Real game over
- Step 24: Deciding where next tile goes
- Step 25: Restart button
- Step 26: Fix test (yeah, I should have done it earlier...)
- Step 27: Adding not on non implemented test
- Step 28: Generating different values of tiles
